<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urban Transport Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-rapid Transport Systems</li><li>Rapid Transport Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Urban transport systems can be categorized into semi-rapid and rapid transport systems. Semi-rapid transport encompasses modes like trams and light rail, which offer moderate speed and stop less frequently, catering to intermediate distances within urban areas. In contrast, rapid transport systems include subways and high-speed trains that provide fast, efficient transit with limited stops over longer distances, significantly reducing travel time. Both types are crucial in managing urban congestion and enhancing accessibility, contributing to sustainable urban mobility.</p></p>
